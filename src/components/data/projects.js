The application is built using the YouTube API, which provides access to video content, channel information, and user data a framework provided by Apple for playing audio and video. The application supports basic playback controls such as play, pause, and seek, and also includes a full-screen mode.    To provide users with a personalized experience, I have implemented user authentication using the YouTube API, which allows users to sign in to their YouTube accounts and access their playlists, subscriptions, and history.
